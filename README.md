### 🧠 About Me
I'm a student who loves exploring how technology works — from how websites are built to how they run on the cloud.  
I’m currently focusing on learning:
- How to deploy and manage applications on the cloud (AWS, DigitalOcean)
- Building responsive web projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Understanding Git, GitHub, and CI/CD pipelines

My goal is to become a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** who can build scalable, efficient systems while continuing to learn every day.
